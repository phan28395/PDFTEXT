## Handoff Mechanism

Each step should create a `STATUS.md` file with:
```markdown
# Current Progress Status

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Task 1 description
- [x] Task 2 description

## Current Step: [Step Number and Name]

## Next Actions
- [ ] Next specific task
- [ ] Dependencies needed
- [ ] Known issues to address

## Important Notes
- Key decisions made
- Configuration details
- Security considerations
- Testing requirements

## Files Created/Modified
- File 1: Purpose and location
- File 2: Purpose and location

## Environment Variables Needed
- VAR_NAME: Description of what it contains
- API_KEY: Where to get it

## Handoff Notes for Next Agent
- Specific instructions for continuation
- Important context about current implementation
- Potential issues to watch out for
```

## Agent Collaboration Rules

1. **Always read STATUS.md first** to understand current progress
2. **Update STATUS.md after completing tasks** with detailed information
3. **Create comprehensive commit messages** describing changes
4. **Leave TODO comments** in code for next agent when needed
5. **Document all configuration changes** in STATUS.md
6. **Test thoroughly** before marking tasks complete
7. **Follow security requirements** from the main plan
8. **Maintain consistent code style** throughout project
