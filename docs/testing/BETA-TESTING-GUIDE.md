### How to Submit Feedback

#### 1. In-App Feedback (Preferred)
- Use the floating feedback button (bottom-right corner)
- Select the appropriate feedback type
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Include screenshots when helpful

#### 2. Feedback Form Fields
- **Title**: Brief description of the issue/suggestion
- **Type**: Select from bug report, feature request, etc.
- **Category**: Specific area (Authentication, PDF Processing, etc.)
- **Severity**: Impact level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Description**: Detailed explanation
- **Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs): Clear step-by-step instructions
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior** (for bugs)
- **Screenshot**: Visual evidence when applicable

#### 3. Quality Feedback Guidelines

**Good Bug Report Example:**
```
Title: PDF upload fails for files larger than 5MB
Type: Bug Report
Category: PDF Processing
Severity: High

Description: When uploading PDF files larger than 5MB, the upload progress bar reaches 100% but then shows an error message "Upload failed".

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Upload PDF"
3. Select a PDF file larger than 5MB
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. Error message appears

Expected Behavior: Large PDF files should upload successfully
Actual Behavior: Upload fails with generic error message

Browser: Chrome 119.0.6045.105
File Size Tested: 7.2MB
```

**Good Feature Request Example:**
```
Title: Add batch PDF processing capability
Type: Feature Request
Category: PDF Processing
Severity: Medium

Description: It would be very helpful to be able to upload and process multiple PDF files at once, rather than uploading them one by one. This would save significant time for users who need to process many documents.

Suggested Implementation:
- Allow selecting multiple files in the upload dialog
- Show progress for each file individually
- Provide a summary of all processed files
- Allow downloading all extracted text as a ZIP file

Use Case: I regularly need to process 20-30 invoices at once for my accounting workflow.
```
